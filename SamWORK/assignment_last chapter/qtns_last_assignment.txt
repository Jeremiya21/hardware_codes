1.
Use TCB to generate a PWM signal with 0 to 255 levels. Use this PWM signal on pin G3_MCU (PF4). Write a function that takes an integer between 0 to 255 and adjust the brightness of the G3 LED strip.
	i.Develop function.
	ii.Call it in main with various inputs.
	iii.Demonstrate to the instructor.
	iv.Cut and past the code below.


2
 Write a function that takes three integers between 0 to 255. First integer determines the R0 brightness (Use TCA), Second one determines the brightness of G3, and last one determines brightness of B3.
	i.Develop function.
	ii.Call it in main with various inputs.
	iii.Connect RGB to one strip of LED and demonstrate various colors to the instructor.
	iv.Cut and past the code below.


3.
Write a function that takes the frequency as input and produces a tone on BUZZER. Use TCB.
Demonstrate to the instructor.
Cut and paste the code.
