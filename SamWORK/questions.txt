Q1.
Write a function to turn on R, G, B or W of the LED strip. 
You should be able to turn them on individually or in a group.
 (R, G, B, W, RG, GB, RW etc.). Call the function in main() and demonstrate.
 Cut and paste your function below..

Q2.
Use toggle function available with GPIO to blink a selected LED with a specified delay between them. 
The implementation must be done in a function. 
Function argument should be the LED you need to turn on and the delay in microseconds between blinking. 
Once you develop, the function, call this function in the main and study how you can dim the LED by pulsing it with longer delay.

Cut and past the function below. Demonstrate the code to your instructor.

Q3.
Write a function that takes 3 delay parameters. One each for R, G and B. Then toggle respective LED with specified delay. 
Call this function in main and create various combination of colors by mixing R, G and B.
Demonstrate to your instructor.
Cut and paste the function below.

Q4.

There is a connector on the PCB (J13). Pin 1 of the connector is connected to port PA2. 
Add this pin to the program and configure this pin as input.
Write a function to return logic level (True or False) on this pin with pull up enabled or disabled. 
Call this function in main to see the logic level on this pin with pull up enabled. Ensure logic high is received.
Pull this pin to ground or apply 0V to this pin. Read the logic level and ensure it is low.
Disable the pull up and apply 3.3V to this pin and ensure logic high is received. 
Demonstrate to the instructor.
Cut and paste the function below.
