1)here we use structure to do so
2)first initialise structure as
  struct info{
    char first_name[10],last_name[10];
    int joining_date;
    float salary;
    
  };
3)here we have one employee e1
4)enter the details of the employee e1 in the order first name,lastname,joiningdate,salary
5)store to structure as
  scanf("%s %s %d %f",e1.first_name,e1.last_name,&e1.joining_date,&e1.salary);
6)access the data and print as below
  printf("the employee %s %s joined the company on %d with salary %f",e1.first_name,e1.last_name,e1.joining_date,e1.salary);
